"""langacore.kit.django.tags
   -------------------------

   Why not django-tagging or django-taggit? Because of other needs. This
   little app provides the following:

   * tags which have authors
   * tags whose authors are members of the staff are official
   * compatibility with migration tools like ``django-evolution``"""
